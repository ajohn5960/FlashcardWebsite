# Flashcard Website
Used the Django web framework to create a website where users can:
- add, update, delete flashcard sets 
- create a user account
- study their flashcard sets or flashcard sets created by other users

## What I learned
- created Django Models to represent objects such as flashcards and users
- set up a virtual environment for the Django project 
- learned about URL patterns and URL routing
- rendered data from the database with a Django model
- designed the website and followed web standards [outlined by w3](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/)
- learned about CSS animations
- learned how to make the website dynamic by using JavaScript 

## What I would like to add
-	a search flashcard set page to search for flashcard sets made by other users
- an option to make the flashcard sets public or private
- an option to study only the flashcards that are starred
